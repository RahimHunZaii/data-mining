## Introduction

Data mining involves discovering patterns and extracting meaningful information from large datasets. This repository includes a variety of data mining techniques, accompanied by code implementations, examples, and visualizations to facilitate understanding and application.

## Techniques

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step in data mining that involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis. It includes handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.

#### Key Features:
- Data cleaning methods
- Techniques for handling missing values
- Feature scaling and transformation

### Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. This section includes algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

#### Key Features:
- K-Means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- Density-based spatial clustering (DBSCAN)

### Classification

Classification involves predicting the category or class of a given data point based on its features. This section covers popular algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.

#### Key Features:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Association Rule Mining

Association rule mining discovers interesting relationships between variables in large datasets. This section includes algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth.

#### Key Features:
- Apriori algorithm
- FP-Growth algorithm
- Market basket analysis examples
